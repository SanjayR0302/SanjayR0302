### 👨‍💻 About Me
Hey! I'm **Sanjay**, a student who loves learning **Java, Python, and Flutter**.  
I enjoy building small projects that make ideas come alive — whether it’s an app, a tool, or a creative design.  
I also love **editing videos** and **designing with Canva**, bringing creativity and logic together.  

Currently, I’m:
- 🚀 Practicing **LeetCode** to improve my logic and problem-solving.  
- 🧠 Learning more about **backend basics** and how real-world apps connect.  
- 🌱 Exploring **Flutter app development** and **UI design**.

I believe learning is a journey — and I’m just getting started ✨
